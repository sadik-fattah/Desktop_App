Featured Projects

Below is a summary of some key projects included in the repository:

JavaFishing_v2
A possible evolution of an earlier "JavaFishing" project. Although details are not specified, it likely involves a GUI-based interactive or simulation-type functionality.

JsonEditor2
Presumably a GUI-based editor that allows users to view, edit, and manipulate JSON files—ideal for data handling and UI components.

JsonUploader
Possibly a utility to upload JSON formatted data to remote services or servers. Could serve backend integration or REST API purposes.

PDF_craking (note the spelling)
Possibly a tool related to PDF manipulation—perhaps extracting text or metadata. Could be a PDF parser or converter.

Privacy_Policy_Generator
Likely automates the creation of privacy policy documents—useful for web or app developers seeking customizable legal documents.

RemoteControlePc_JavaSwing
Suggests a remote control application built with Java Swing—likely offering functionalities such as remote desktop or system command control.

WifiCutter / WifiCut / netCutter
A series of utilities presumably aimed at network management—possibly tools to disconnect or manage Wi-Fi connections. These might involve low-level networking operations (handle with care regarding network permissions and legal compliance).

streamin_mvn_Swing
A streaming application built using Maven and Swing. Might enable media streaming capabilities or system data streaming with a Java GUI.

theserver
Possibly a lightweight Java server (e.g., HTTP or socket-based) for handling client/server communication.

Other Projects like rotationText, BloggerContent, BrowseJson, ChangeIP, Programming_Language, and YD appear to focus on diverse utilities and educational tools.

Presentation Outline (in English)

You can present these projects with this structure:

**Project Descriptions**  
- JavaFishing_v2: A refined simulation or game-based GUI app—details to be confirmed.  
- JsonEditor2: A desktop JSON file editor with GUI components for viewing and editing.  
- JsonUploader: A utility for uploading JSON data, possibly to remote APIs or servers.  
- PDF_craking: Likely a PDF manipulation tool (e.g. parsing, extracting).  
- Privacy_Policy_Generator: Automates the generation of privacy policy documents.  
- RemoteControlePc_JavaSwing: Remote PC control interface using Java Swing.  
- WifiCutter / WifiCut / netCutter: Network utility tools focusing on Wi-Fi connectivity management.  
- streamin_mvn_Swing: A streaming-capable GUI app built with Swing and Maven.  
- theserver: A minimal Java server for networking or client communications.  
- Additional Utilities (rotationText, BloggerContent, BrowseJson, ChangeIP, Programming_Language, YD): Each offers specialized functionality—ranging from text transformations to content browsing and system settings automation.

**Skills Demonstrated**  
- Proficient use of **Java Swing** for desktop GUI.  
- Working with **JSON** for data parsing and upload functionality.  
- File processing capabilities via **PDF handling utilities**.  
- Basic **network operations** and client/server design.  
- Automation and tool development (document generation, IP control).  
- Use of **Maven** for project structure and dependency management.

**Conclusion**  
This repository is a rich resource showcasing practical desktop applications in Java. It reflects a foundation in GUI development, data handling, network control, automation, and utility tool creation.
